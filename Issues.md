# Issues

- OS of the student pc can be Windows, Mac or Linux
- Windows version of the user can be really old
- The pc of the student can be of any language (impossible to know what is the right button on the menu)
- The language of the student could be any and the keyboard is difficult to use
- The student can be completely ignorant about "variables", "call a method", "colon/semicolon/comma"
- The OS of the student could be confugured to hide the file exensions (and usually them are)
- The student could be not able to create a simple text file or to change the extension
- The student keyboard is configured to use custom action on the functions keys (with no evidence of this)

# How to

- Change the default behavior to make visible the file extensions

- Change the default behavior and make the "F" keys work (on different pc brands)
