# Just Eat API

Use the public API to shows how to interact with Web API.  
Use the Just Eat recruitment test project: https://github.com/justeat/JustEat.RecruitmentTest  
  
The API key is changed by Just Eat every n months.  
Unfortunately they recently decided to not make it public anymore...

# Requirements

- requests  (to install it run ```pip install requests``` on the command prompt (Win) or in the Terminal (MAC/Linux))


# Note/FAQ

The code use .format() method instead of f"" so it is running also on Python 2.7.x .  
If you are not able to use pip you can search on Google .how to install it (Python 3)  
or you can use ````sudo pip install requests``` if you have an error about permissions (Python 2)
